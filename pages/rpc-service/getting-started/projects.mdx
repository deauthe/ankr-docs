# Projects

<Callout type="tip">
Available for [Premium](/rpc-service/service-plans/#service-plans-comparison) users only.
</Callout>

The Projects feature aims to provide a business that manages multiple projects — dApps/platforms (powered with Ankr's blockchain interaction) — with the means to organize, monitor, control, and secure the endpoints used to power each of those projects.

 The Projects feature is built to help you with the following:

  * **Organize endpoints**: Now you can organize your endpoints by their specific sphere of usage — by project.
  * **Monitor projects**: Our Dashboard now serves to build your insights around a particular project's statistics, equipping your business with proactive tools for decision-making.
  * **Freeze projects**: You now have a single-click ability to put your projects on/off handbrake — to stop/start powering your projects with our endpoints.
  * **Safeguard endpoints**: We have your project's back covered with the whitelist security mechanisms safeguarding your endpoints from abuse and enabling you to define domains, IPs, or smart contracts allowed for endpoints communication.

In simple terms, each new project provides a new unique token to be used in your private endpoints. Your projects differ from each other based on that token. The endpoints with the same token power a single project. And you can view each project's statistics in the Dashboard.

**Supported chains**:

  * `Arbitrum`, `BNB Smart Chain`, `Ethereum`, `Gnosis`, `Polygon`

**Supported methods**:

  * `eth_call`, `eth_getLogs`, `eth_sendRawTransaction`
